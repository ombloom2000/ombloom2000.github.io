                “For me, it was about opening my mind,” Vevers said of his inspiration, which stemmed from a road trip up California’s scenic Route 1 that had him stopping at Nepenthe, the famous Big Sur restaurant that opened in 1949 and is still a must for sweeping views, Ambrosia burgers and shopping for tie-dyes and wind chimes. Inspiration led to collaboration, with Vevers tapping artist Kaffe Fassett, whose family has owned and operated Nepenthe since the start. The designer used Fassett’s Sixties-era psychedelic florals on prints that were a collection through line. Tailoring was a more significant part of the collection than usual, with mannish, rockabilly-style blazers balancing grungy-glam patchwork floral print dresses with swishy hems, and western booties or cool platform creeper sneakers anchoring everything in the now. And while the designer embraced the brand’s leather legacy in shearlings, parkas and jackets, the pieces in this collection were clearly targeted to a fearless hipster who seeks to be a street style star rather than a fashion victim. -Booth Moore and Jean E.
